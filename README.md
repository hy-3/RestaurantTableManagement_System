Design/implement a system that manages seating for a Restaurant.

Our restaurant has round tables.
Tables come in different sizes that can accommodate 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 people.
People arrive at our restaurant in groups of 6 or less.
People in the same group want to be seated at the same table.
You can seat a group at any table that has enough empty seats for them. If it's not possible to accommodate them, they're willing to wait.
Once they're seated, they can stay as long as they want and you cannot ask them to move to another table (i.e. you cannot move them to make space for another group).
In terms of fairness of seating order: seat groups in the order they arrive, but seat opportunistically. For example: a group of 6 is waiting for a table and there are 4 empty seats at a table for 6; if a group of 2 arrives you may put them at the table for 6 but only if you have nowhere else to put them. This may mean that the group of 6 waits a long time, possibly until they become frustrated and leave.

```
public class Table {
  public final int size; //number of chairs around this table
}

public class CustomerGroup {
  public final int size; //number of people in the group
}

public class SeatingManager {
  /* Constructor */
  public SeatingManager(List<Table> tables);
  /* Group arrives and wants to be seated. */ public void arrives(CustomerGroup group);
  /* Whether seated or not, the group leaves the restaurant. */ public void leaves(CustomerGroup group);
  /* Return the table at which the group is seated, or null if they are not seated (whether they're waiting or already left). */
  public Table locate(CustomerGroup group); 
}
```

Choose the data structures you need for the SeatingManager and then implement the constructor and public methods (arrives, leaves, locate). You may modify these classes in any way you like, and you may add other
